# Allocation

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sc-quartz-allocation.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Initial Allocation: Team 20%, DAO 80%</p></figcaption></figure>

The community will become responsible for the spending of the DAO's QUARTZ upon deployment of Snapshot and then, the DAO.

* **Insurance**

QUARTZ might be used to capitalize an insurance fund. Once in place, Quartz stakers will benefit from the coverage.

* **Liquidity Mining/Bonds**

QUARTZ can be distributed to incentivize additional liquidity (e.g. through KPI options).

* **TVL Mining**

QUARTZ can be distributed to increase the TVL of Sandclock's metavaults (e.g. through KPI options).

* **Ecosystem Development/Grants**

QUARTZ can be granted to incentivize development or marketing of our growing ecosystem.

## Permalocked Tokens

~~At least 30% of QUARTZ shall remain locked in perpetuity. The purpose of this QUARTZ is to incentivize TVL growth, Giving, or other actions on-chain **without diluting existing holders.** It achieves this through a delegative function, whereby a trusted backend can delegate voting power to an address on Polygon without transferring ownership of the tokens.~~

~~It was initially designed in order to incentivize giving, but it can fulfill other objectives while preserving the value of QUARTZ.~~
