# Strategies

One of Sandclock's mission is to bring safe, sustainable yield to anyone looking to generate a return on their deposits. Thus, yield generation is Sandclock's beating heart.

To this end, each Metavault supports a single highly curated strategy, selected specifically to endure changing market conditions and perform well throughout themâ€”bull, bear, or crab. The risks for each strategy as well as the conditions for their success are carefully disclosed on the "Strategy Info" tab inside each "Strategy Page".

We have 2 sets of strategies: v1 and v2.

v1 are our old strategies following our metavault structure. These strategies are deprecated and you shouldn't deposit on them anymore.

v2 are our new strategies which follow the ERC4626 Vault standard.

You can find details on each of these in the next pages.
