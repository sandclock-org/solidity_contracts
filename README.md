# Introduction

**The world's first trustless wealth management platform.**

HNWIâ€™s use opaque wealth management platforms operated by multiple layers of third parties to allocate their capital to specific asset classes and generate a return on idle capital. Sandclock does too, with more elegance, trustlessness, and sustainability.

When a deposit is made to a predetermined strategy chosen by the user, **principal and yield are automatically split.** They **can then be further subdivided arbitrarily, and streamed in real time to anything you want,** trustlessly, leveraging the composability of smart contracts.

* **Keep:** what you keep.
* **Give:** what you donate to a not-for-profit or program; it entitles you to an NFT that can be burned for a charitable tax deduction.
* **Invest:** what you allocate to an asset you want the profits to be transmuted into.
* **Custom:** what you allocate to another wallet or smart contract (that supports it!); _This is key as it leads to many novel use cases that we will be announcing in due time_.
